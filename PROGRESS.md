# Scablanders Development Progress

## Phase 1 Complete! 🎉

We have successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture** of the Scablanders game development.

### ✅ What's Working Now

**Development Environment:**
- ✅ Vite + Cloudflare Workers integrated development server
- ✅ Hot Module Reload for client-side development
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with path aliases (`@shared`, `@client`, `@server`)
- ✅ Phaser 3 game engine loading and rendering

**Project Structure:**
```

├── server/          # Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects ✅  
├── shared/          # Common TypeScript types/models ✅
├── public/          # Static assets served by Worker ✅
├── scripts/         # Build/deploy utilities (empty, ready for future)
├── package.json     # Updated with proper scripts ✅
├── vite.config.ts   # Vite + Cloudflare plugin configuration ✅
├── tsconfig.json    # TypeScript with path aliases ✅
└── wrangler.jsonc   # Cloudflare Worker configuration ✅
```

**Game Client (Basic):**
- ✅ Phaser 3 game loads with desert-themed Scablands map
- ✅ Interactive resource nodes with hover effects
- ✅ Wallet connection UI (placeholder - connects to MetaMask)
- ✅ Credits display and basic HUD elements
- ✅ Responsive design with game canvas + HTML overlay UI

**API Server:**
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker with Durable Object integration
- ✅ Basic API routing (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`, `/api/profile`, `/api/world/*`, `/api/mission/*`)
- ✅ CORS headers for development
- ✅ Health check endpoint working (`/api/health`)
- ✅ Placeholder authentication endpoints
- ✅ Error handling and JSON responses

**Shared Type System:**
- ✅ Comprehensive interfaces for all game entities
- ✅ Enums for resource types, mission status, upgrades
- ✅ API request/response types for type safety
- ✅ Validation helpers for addresses and token IDs

### 🧪 Testing the Setup

**Start Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173
```

**Test API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5173/api/health

# Auth nonce (placeholder)  
curl http://localhost:5173/api/auth/nonce

# Profile (mock data)
curl http://localhost:5173/api/profile

# World state (placeholder)
curl http://localhost:5173/api/world/state
```

**Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build
# Creates optimized client bundle + Worker script
```

### 🎮 Current Game Features

**What You Can Do Right Now:**
- Connect MetaMask wallet (basic connection, no authentication yet)
- View the Scablands desert map
- Click on resource nodes (shows console logs)

## Phase 2 Complete! 🎉

We have successfully completed **Phase 2: Authentication & NFT Integration**!

### ✅ Phase 2 Achievements

**SIWE Authentication System:**
- ✅ Complete Sign-In-With-Ethereum implementation using `siwe` library
- ✅ Nonce generation and verification with Workers KV caching
- ✅ JWT session tokens with HTTP-only cookies
- ✅ Authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- ✅ Proper wallet message signing with viem/wagmi integration
- ✅ `/api/auth/nonce`, `/api/auth/verify`, `/api/auth/logout` endpoints

**NFT Ownership Integration:**
- ✅ Alchemy SDK integration for Ethereum mainnet queries
- ✅ Fringe Drifters NFT contract integration (`0xe3B399AAb015D2C0D787ECAd40410D88f4f4cA50`)
- ✅ Real-time NFT ownership lookup with KV caching (5-10 min TTL)
- ✅ Drifter registry with 50 unique characters (stats, traits, hire costs)
- ✅ `/api/mercenaries` endpoint showing hire costs (0 for owned NFTs)
- ✅ `/api/profile` endpoint with actual owned Drifters data
- ✅ `/api/test-nft/[address]` debug endpoint for testing

**Enhanced Client Authentication:**
- ✅ ScablandersAuth class with reactive wallet connection
- ✅ Full SIWE message signing and verification flow
- ✅ Session management with automatic login status detection
- ✅ Authenticated API requests with credentials
- ✅ Wallet connection UI with proper state management

**Infrastructure & Deployment:**
- ✅ Wrangler secrets configuration (`ALCHEMY_API_KEY`)
- ✅ KV namespaces created and configured (`AUTH_KV`, `KV`)
- ✅ `.dev.vars` file for local development
- ✅ Worker types regenerated for proper TypeScript support
- ✅ CORS headers configured for localhost development

### 🧪 Testing NFT Integration

**Live NFT Ownership Testing:**
```bash
# Test NFT ownership for any Ethereum address
curl "http://localhost:5173/api/test-nft/YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS"

# Example response:
{
  "address": "0x...",
  "ownedDrifters": [1, 15, 23],
  "count": 3,
  "alchemyApiKeyConfigured": true
}
```

**Authentication Flow:**
```bash
# 1. Get nonce
curl http://localhost:5173/api/auth/nonce

# 2. Sign message with wallet (done in client)
# 3. Verify signature
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/auth/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "...", "signature": "..."}'

# 4. Access authenticated endpoints
curl -b "CF_ACCESS_TOKEN=..." http://localhost:5173/api/profile
curl -b "CF_ACCESS_TOKEN=..." http://localhost:5173/api/mercenaries
```

### 🎮 Current Game Features (Enhanced)

**What You Can Do Now:**
- 🔐 **Full SIWE wallet authentication** - Sign messages to prove NFT ownership
- 🎨 **Real NFT integration** - Your actual Fringe Drifters are loaded from blockchain
- 💰 **Dynamic hire costs** - Owned NFTs cost 0 to hire, others have market rates
- 👤 **Personalized profiles** - See your real wallet address and owned Drifters
- 📊 **Drifter stats** - Each NFT has unique combat, scavenging, tech, speed stats
- 🔄 **Live caching** - NFT data cached for performance with automatic refresh

### 📊 Drifter Registry Sample

The system includes a rich drifter database with unique characters:
```json
{
  "1": {
    "name": "Dust Walker",
    "combat": 7, "scavenging": 8, "tech": 5, "speed": 6,
    "hireCost": 50, "rarity": "common"
  },
  "9": {
    "name": "Rad Stalker", 
    "combat": 8, "scavenging": 8, "tech": 7, "speed": 8,
    "hireCost": 150, "rarity": "rare"
  }
}
```

### 📋 Next Steps (Phase 3)

With authentication and NFT integration complete, we're ready for **Phase 3: Durable Objects & Game State**:

### 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server with HMR
npm run build           # Build for production  
npm run deploy          # Deploy to Cloudflare (future)
