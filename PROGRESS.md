# Scablanders Development Progress

## Phase 1 Complete! 🎉

We have successfully completed **Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture** of the Scablanders game development.

### ✅ What's Working Now

**Development Environment:**
- ✅ Vite + Cloudflare Workers integrated development server
- ✅ Hot Module Reload for client-side development
- ✅ TypeScript compilation with path aliases (`@shared`, `@client`, `@server`)
- ✅ Phaser 3 game engine loading and rendering

**Project Structure:**
```
scablanders/
├── client/          # Phaser 3 game client ✅
├── server/          # Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects ✅  
├── shared/          # Common TypeScript types/models ✅
├── public/          # Static assets served by Worker ✅
├── scripts/         # Build/deploy utilities (empty, ready for future)
├── package.json     # Updated with proper scripts ✅
├── vite.config.ts   # Vite + Cloudflare plugin configuration ✅
├── tsconfig.json    # TypeScript with path aliases ✅
└── wrangler.jsonc   # Cloudflare Worker configuration ✅
```

**Game Client (Basic):**
- ✅ Phaser 3 game loads with desert-themed Scablands map
- ✅ Interactive resource nodes with hover effects
- ✅ Wallet connection UI (placeholder - connects to MetaMask)
- ✅ Credits display and basic HUD elements
- ✅ Responsive design with game canvas + HTML overlay UI

**API Server:**
- ✅ Cloudflare Worker with Durable Object integration
- ✅ Basic API routing (`/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`, `/api/profile`, `/api/world/*`, `/api/mission/*`)
- ✅ CORS headers for development
- ✅ Health check endpoint working (`/api/health`)
- ✅ Placeholder authentication endpoints
- ✅ Error handling and JSON responses

**Shared Type System:**
- ✅ Comprehensive interfaces for all game entities
- ✅ Enums for resource types, mission status, upgrades
- ✅ API request/response types for type safety
- ✅ Validation helpers for addresses and token IDs

### 🧪 Testing the Setup

**Start Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173
```

**Test API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5173/api/health

# Auth nonce (placeholder)  
curl http://localhost:5173/api/auth/nonce

# Profile (mock data)
curl http://localhost:5173/api/profile

# World state (placeholder)
curl http://localhost:5173/api/world/state
```

**Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build
# Creates optimized client bundle + Worker script
```

### 🎮 Current Game Features

**What You Can Do Right Now:**
- Connect MetaMask wallet (basic connection, no authentication yet)
- View the Scablands desert map
- Click on resource nodes (shows console logs)
- See placeholder Credits balance
- Experience responsive Phaser 3 gameplay

**Visual Elements:**
- Desert-brown background representing the Scablands
- Orange circular resource nodes (ore, scrap, organic) 
- Gold welcome text with Fringe universe flavor
- Dark UI panels with sci-fi styling
- Wallet connection status display

### 📋 Next Steps (Phase 2)

Now that our foundation is solid, the next major milestone is **Phase 2: Authentication & NFT Integration**:

1. **Implement Sign-In-With-Ethereum (SIWE)** 
   - Proper wallet authentication with message signing
   - JWT session management
   - Secure API authentication middleware

2. **NFT Ownership System**
   - Fringe Drifters contract integration
   - On-chain owner lookup with caching
   - Drifter registry with stats and traits

3. **Enhanced Client**
   - SIWE authentication flow
   - Player profile display with owned NFTs
   - API integration for real data

### 🚀 Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server with HMR
npm run build           # Build for production  
npm run deploy          # Deploy to Cloudflare (future)
npm run test            # Run tests (future)
npm run lint            # Code linting (future)
npm run format          # Code formatting (future)
```

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

**Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects:**
- Edge-deployed serverless architecture
- Single global world state via Durable Objects
- Sub-50ms latency worldwide
- Automatic scaling

**Vite + Phaser 3:**
- Fast development with instant HMR
- Optimized production builds  
- Modern ES modules
- Tree-shaking for minimal bundle size

**TypeScript Throughout:**
- Shared types between client/server
- Compile-time safety
- IntelliSense and refactoring support

### 🎯 Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Goals - All Met:**
- [x] Restructured project into clean architecture
- [x] Installed and configured all core dependencies  
- [x] Vite + Cloudflare Workers integration working
- [x] Basic Phaser 3 game loads and renders
- [x] API server responds to requests
- [x] Shared TypeScript models defined
- [x] Development workflow established

**Ready for Phase 2!** 🚀

The foundation is rock-solid and development velocity should accelerate significantly from here. All the complex build system integration is complete, and we can now focus on implementing game features.
