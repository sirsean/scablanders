# Live Countdown Timer Test Guide

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

The Active Missions panel countdown timer was **static** - it only updated when new data arrived from the server. Now it's **live** and updates every second regardless of data updates.

### **Before vs After:**

| **Behavior**        | **Before**                | **After**           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Timer Updates**   | Only with new data        | Every second        |
| **Progress Bar**    | Static until data refresh | Smoothly animates   |
| **User Experience** | Felt broken/stale         | Live and responsive |

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)**

1. Start the game: `npm run dev`
2. Login with wallet and start a mission
3. Open Active Missions panel (click the missions button in UI)
4. **Watch the countdown timer - it should tick down every second!**

### **Option 2: Detailed Test**

1. Start a mission with any resource node
2. Open Active Missions panel
3. Observe these elements updating **every second:**
   - ⏱️ **Countdown timer:** `5m 23s` → `5m 22s` → `5m 21s`
   - 📊 **Progress percentage:** `45.2%` → `45.3%` → `45.4%`
   - 📈 **Progress bar:** Gradually fills from left to right
   - ✅ **Completion status:** When timer reaches 0, shows "COMPLETE!"

### **Option 3: Manual Mission Completion**

```javascript
// Start a mission, then immediately complete it to see the transition
fetch('/api/missions/complete-oldest', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
})
	.then((r) => r.json())
	.then(console.log);
```

## 🎯 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Live Countdown Behavior:**

- **Timer text** updates every second: `15m 30s` → `15m 29s` → `15m 28s`
- **Progress bar** smoothly fills as time passes
- **Percentage** incrementally increases: `78.5%` → `78.6%` → `78.7%`
- **Color changes:** Yellow timer → Green "COMPLETE!" when finished
- **Button appears:** "Collect Rewards" button shows when mission completes

### **✅ Performance Optimizations:**

- Timer **stops automatically** when panel is closed (no background processing)
- Timer **stops automatically** when no active missions (no unnecessary updates)
- Timer **cleans up** on page unload (no memory leaks)

### **✅ Smooth User Experience:**

- No flickering or jumping of elements
- Updates feel smooth and natural (1-second intervals)
- Panel remains responsive during updates

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Timer Appears Static:**

1. Check console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure Active Missions panel is open and visible
3. Verify there are active missions in the list

### **If Timer Updates Too Fast/Slow:**

- Should update exactly **every 1 second**
- If different, check browser dev tools for performance issues

### **If Memory Leaks Occur:**

- Timer should stop when panel is closed
- Check browser dev tools → Performance → Memory tab
- Should not see constantly growing intervals

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

The live timer works by:

1. **Storing mission data** when panel updates (not just displaying it once)
2. **Starting a 1-second interval** that recalculates countdown every second
3. **Only updating when panel is visible** (performance optimization)
4. **Automatically stopping** when panel is closed or no missions exist
5. **Cleaning up properly** on page unload to prevent memory leaks

### **Key Functions Added:**

- `startLiveTimer()` - Begins 1-second interval updates
- `stopLiveTimer()` - Stops interval and cleans up resources
- `renderContent()` - Renders with current timestamp (called every second)
- Auto-cleanup on panel close and page unload

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Countdown timer decrements every second**  
✅ **Progress bar gradually fills as time passes**  
✅ **Completion status updates to "COMPLETE!" when timer reaches zero**  
✅ **Timer stops when panel is closed (no background processing)**  
✅ **Timer stops when no active missions (performance)**  
✅ **No memory leaks or runaway intervals**

The countdown is now **live and responsive** - no more waiting for server updates to see time changes! ⏰
