# UI Responsiveness Test - Resource Depletion Updates

## 🚀 **Performance Improvements Made**

### 1. **Fixed WebSocket Event Listeners**
- Fixed `worldStateUpdate` event dispatching from WebSocketManager to GameStateManager
- Events now properly trigger immediate UI updates

### 2. **Optimized Resource Node Updates**
- **Before:** Destroyed and recreated ALL nodes on any change (slow, flickery)
- **After:** Only updates the specific node that changed (fast, smooth)
- Added visual flash effect when nodes are updated

### 3. **Eliminated Polling Interference**
- **Before:** 30-second polling overrode WebSocket updates
- **After:** Polling only runs when WebSocket is disconnected

### 4. **Added Manual Completion Endpoints**
- `/api/missions/complete` - Complete specific mission by ID
- `/api/missions/complete-oldest` - Complete oldest active mission for testing

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Option 1: Browser Dev Console (Fastest)**
1. Start the game: `npm run dev`
2. Login with wallet and start a mission
3. Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   // Complete your oldest active mission immediately
   fetch('/api/missions/complete-oldest', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   ```

### **Option 2: Manual Testing**
1. Start a mission targeting a resource node
2. Wait for mission to complete naturally (30 minutes)
3. Watch for immediate UI updates when mission completes

## ✅ **What to Look For**

### **Immediate Updates (Should happen within 1-2 seconds):**
- 🔢 **Resource node text updates** - shows new `currentYield` amount
- ✨ **Visual flash effect** - node briefly scales/glows green when updated
- 🎨 **Node appearance** - depleted nodes become grayed out
- 🔔 **Notifications** - mission complete + resource depletion notifications

### **Console Logs to Verify:**
```
[GameState] Received world state update: {...}
[GameState] Updating resource nodes from WebSocket: [...]
[GameScene] Updating node ore-1 yield: 25
[GameDO] Node after depletion: currentYield=25, depletion=25
```

### **WebSocket Status:**
- Top of screen should show "Real-time Connected" notification
- Connection status should be green/connected
- No "Periodic update" messages in console (means WebSocket is working)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Updates Are Still Slow:**
1. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
2. Look for "Connection Lost" notifications in game
3. Check if "Periodic update (WebSocket disconnected)" appears in console

### **If Resource Nodes Don't Update:**
1. Check console for `[GameDO] Depleting resources from node...` messages
2. Verify WebSocket messages: `[GameState] Received world state update`
3. Look for `[GameScene] Updating node ... yield: ...` messages

### **Test WebSocket Connection:**
```javascript
// Check WebSocket status
console.log('WebSocket connected:', gameState.getState().wsConnected)
console.log('Real-time mode:', gameState.getState().realTimeMode)
```

## 📊 **Expected Performance**

| **Action** | **Before** | **After** |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Mission Complete → UI Update | 30+ seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| Resource Node Visual Update | Full recreation (slow) | Incremental update (fast) |
| WebSocket Event Processing | Broken event names | Working properly |
| Polling Interference | Always ran (conflicted) | Only when disconnected |

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Resource depletion updates appear within 2 seconds of mission completion**  
✅ **Individual nodes update smoothly without recreating all nodes**  
✅ **Visual feedback shows which node was updated (flash effect)**  
✅ **WebSocket "Real-time Connected" status shows in notifications**  
✅ **No periodic polling messages when WebSocket is connected**  

The UI should now be **dramatically more responsive** to resource changes! 🚀
